# Iris_recognition
Iris recognition is used for identifying people based on unique patterns within the ring-shaped region surrounding the pupil of the eye. The 
iris can be a brown, blue, gray, or greenish color, with complex patterns that are visible upon close inspection. Because it makes use of a 
biological characteristic, iris recognition is considered a form of biometric verification.
In iris recognition, the identification process is carried out by gathering one or more detailed images of the eye with a sophisticated, high resolution digital camera at visible or infrared (IR) wavelengths, and then using a specialized computer program called a matching engine 
to compare the subject's iris pattern with images stored in a database. The matching engine can compare millions of images per second with 
a level of precision comparable to conventional fingerprinting or digital finger scanning.
